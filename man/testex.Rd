\title{A syntactic helper for writing quick and easy example tests}
\usage{
testex(..., val, envir = parent.frame())
}
\arguments{
\item{...}{Expressions to evaluated. \code{.} will be replaced with the
expression passed to \code{val}, and may be used as a shorthand for the
last example result.}

\item{val}{A value to test against. By default, this will use the example's
\code{.Last.value}.}

\item{envir}{An environment in which tests should be evaluated. By default
the parent environment where tests are evaluated.}
}
\description{
A wrapper around \code{stopifnot} that allows you to use \code{.} to refer to
\code{.Last.value} and preserve the last non-test output from an example.
